Dexter of Ebonheart: Can a MacBook be installed a Linux?
                     My brother tried to factory reset his MacBook and now it's 
                     stuck saying "no packages could be installed. Restart to continue" 
                     then it says that again when he reboots
                     I told him install Linux and he said 
                     "fuck it, I don't care as long as I can get online and watch porn"

DrownNotably:        depends on how new it is

Shardion:            also yes, you can linux a macbook, just not some recent ones
                     newer ones have this stupid security chip
                     blocks anything but macos from starting

Dexter of Ebonheart: He said about 10 years old. I'd have to get the exact model information from him

dmt:                 your 10 year old brother needs to get online to watch porn?
                     OH
                     
Shardion:            ANOTHER FOR THE FORTUNES LMAO

Dexter of Ebonheart: My brother is 29. He can go to porn stores. It's okay

Shardion: remember, stripping down windows with shit like Group Policies takes the spikes away from the cactus, but you still don't want a cactus in your ass
Phate6660: > you still don't want a cactus in your ass
           That is a legit fetish, I'm not even joking.
Shardion: what the fuck people
Phate6660: ||there are literal cactus dildos, thorns and all, that people use||
Shardion: FUCKING OW

Arctic: Tredix is the king of boomers
Tredix: Ye- no wait.
%
Arctic: Could we maybe have mods so this can be prevented in the future?
%
Arctic: I probably sound the like the ultimate boomer but when I use Arch I
        want to use Arch and when I use Debian I want to use Debian
%
Arctic: Imagine thinking Ubuntu was better than Fedora
%
Arctic: oh shoot
Arctic: there is another kernel update
Arctic: time to debloat my kernel :)
%
Dexter of Ebonheart: a small botnet of one million bots
%
Guillotine: Imagine not using Debian
Dexter of Ebonheart: imagine being able to install debian
%
Hoshi: Dexter of Ebonheart, you can't star your own messages.

DDOSed: I'm actually surprised firefox respects /etc/hosts
Martianhunter: Firefox doesn't get a choice in the matter.

Phate6660: Welp, I'm gonna go get coma-stoned, eat some food, and go to bed.
%
Phate6660: Honestly, I'd take Windows over using SystemD.
%
Phate6660: Honestly, the very concept of a country is stupid.
%
Phate6660: I love meat. I don't know what I'd do without it.
%
Phate6660: I think that over the course of my years of Linux, I had forgotten
           about why I really hated Windows. Over the course of these past few
           hours, not only have the flames of hatred been rekindled, but they
           are burning hotter and brighter than ever before.
%
Phate6660: The problem is that people just don't want to admit to themselves
           how evil and disgusting humanity is.

Dexter of Ebonheart: > "This branch has no conflicts with the base branch"
Sharidon: This branch conflicts with my morals

Phate6660: >implying that netbooks aren't a thing anymore
Phate6660: Pfffffft, netbooks are too still a thing.
Phate6660: Just a little while ago I bought a refurbished lenovo netbook locally for like ~$50.
...
Phate6660: Oh wait, I don't think it's Lenovo.
Phate6660: It was an ASUS EeePC.
Phate6660: That came with Windows XP.
...
Arctic: it looks kind of like a tiny macbook
Arctic: the old ones
Phate6660: Now I can never use it again, thank you.
%
Phate6660: Tfw all the comments on your post are about the music you're listening to and not the
           actual contents of the post itself.
%
Phate6660: Don't be a distroist, it's like the Linux equivalent of being a racist.
Shardion: So Arch users are the ultimate racists?
%
Phate6660: Tfw Gentoo and LFS are too easy but Debian is a hurdle you will never get over.
%
Phate6660: Who hurt you in your life so much that you would want to use Debian?
%
Phate6660: I gave up. Debian mentally broke me. It made me hate Linux for a while.
%
Sharidon: quiet, gentoo user
          go change runlevel to 0 (please dont)
%
Tredix: .iam Powershell
%
Tredix: am I done with distro-hopping? I think so.
%
Tredix: > "the dick only makes it better"
Phate6660: Probably the truest thing I've read on this server.
%
Tredix: "I can `mount` in my dreams, but I can't `unmount` the pain"
dmt: Huh. Same except I can't `mount` my dreams, but I do `mount` in them. ;)
%
dmt: @Phate6660 I get that. Also, don't microwave PC parts, that's a serious fire hazard.
dmt: Use a blowtorch instead.
Phate6660: Oh, good idea. I have like a couple of those lying around somewhere.

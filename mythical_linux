Arctic: Tredix is the king of boomers
Tredix: Ye- no wait.
%
Arctic: Could we maybe have mods so this can be prevented in the future?
%
Arctic: I probably sound the like the ultimate boomer but when I use Arch I
        want to use Arch and when I use Debian I want to use Debian
%
Arctic: [Deleted bad joke]
%
Arctic: Just use your BIOS
        OSs are for noobs
Phate6660: Pffffft, using an OS is stupid.
           Obviously you need to hack into the mainframe using electromagnetic waves and control technology that way. Don't forget to use a block of wood to conduct electricity better.

Shardion: emacs i need you
dmt: :emacs: I'm here for you, babe.
%
Arctic: Imagine thinking Ubuntu was better than Fedora
%
Arctic: oh shoot
Arctic: there is another kernel update
Arctic: time to debloat my kernel :)
%
Dexter of Ebonheart: I've never had any full on problems with systemd on mint. Just confusion when I tried to do something like `/etc/init.d/disdick restart`
Dexter of Ebonheart: But I was not a fan of the actual maintenance commands I needed to do things. And I don't like the direction it's heading. So no D for me.

Guillotine: Imagine not using Debian
Dexter of Ebonheart: imagine being able to install debian
%
dmt: hmmm
     if i could get a phone that just ran emacs
     that'd be the best
     It needs to be bare metal -> Kernel -> Emacs
     otherwise what's the point
Phate6660: That'll never happen unless you make it yourself.
dmt: Time to pull myself up by my boot straps
     Introducing... the ePhone
     :emacs:Phone
     I wonder if apple would sue
Dexter of Ebonheart: They would sue and claim it was their idea originally

DDOSed: I'm actually surprised firefox respects /etc/hosts
Martianhunter: Firefox doesn't get a choice in the matter.
%
Phate6660: Welp, I'm gonna go get coma-stoned, eat some food, and go to bed.
%
Phate6660: Honestly, I'd take Windows over using SystemD.
%
Phate6660: Honestly, the very concept of a country is stupid.
%
Phate6660: I love meat. I don't know what I'd do without it.
%
Phate6660: I think that over the course of my years of Linux, I had forgotten
           about why I really hated Windows. Over the course of these past few
           hours, not only have the flames of hatred been rekindled, but they
           are burning hotter and brighter than ever before.
%
Phate6660: The problem is that people just don't want to admit to themselves
           how evil and disgusting humanity is.
%
Phate6660: I JUST HAD THE BIGGEST DERP
           i was trying to figure out why the fuck mpc was skipping like 12 tracks at a time when switching to the next song
           i had fucking random mode on without realizing it
           fml

Phate6660: >implying that netbooks aren't a thing anymore
Phate6660: Pfffffft, netbooks are too still a thing.
Phate6660: Just a little while ago I bought a refurbished lenovo netbook locally for like ~$50.
...
Phate6660: Oh wait, I don't think it's Lenovo.
Phate6660: It was an ASUS EeePC.
Phate6660: That came with Windows XP.
...
Arctic: it looks kind of like a tiny macbook
Arctic: the old ones
Phate6660: Now I can never use it again, thank you.

Phate6660: Tfw all the comments on your post are about the music you're listening to and not the
           actual contents of the post itself.
%
Phate6660: Don't be a distroist, it's like the Linux equivalent of being a racist.
Shardion: So Arch users are the ultimate racists?
%
Phate6660: Tfw Gentoo and LFS are too easy but Debian is a hurdle you will never get over.
%
Phate6660: Who hurt you in your life so much that you would want to use Debian?
%
Phate6660: I gave up. Debian mentally broke me. It made me hate Linux for a while.
%
Phate6660: fdisk > cfdisk, parted
           Oh God I just had another ptsd flashback to fucking Void.
           I was forced to use fucking cfdisk to partition my disks.
           I hated every second of it.
           cfdisk is so god damn confusing, it makes no sense half the time.
           I almost gave up on the Void install like 6 times because of it.
           On top of being confusing, it's missing a lot of features that are available in fdisk.
           For example, the ability to change the disk label to MBR or GPT.

Phate6660: [meme about someone calling html a programming language]
Shardion: HTML is a markup language
Phate6660: Yeah, but people don't seem to understand that.
           I can't tell you how many times I've seen people call it a programming language.
           And every time I go: "DID YOU EVER EVEN READ THE FUCKING NAME!?"
           And they go: "...Uh............ HTML?"
%
Phate6660: OMG
           Look at the soliders chest
           Fucking Debian
           Lol
           Does this mean that Debian is a soldier for SystemD?
Shardion: there had better be artix just fucking razing them with a flamethrower
%
Shardion: quiet, gentoo user
          go change runlevel to 0 (please dont)
%
Shardion: alright sweet. progctl can now read your XDG_CONFIG_HOME environment variable
          better have it set nerds

Tredix: .iam Powershell

Tredix: am I done with distro-hopping? I think so.

Tredix: > "the dick only makes it better"
Phate6660: Probably the truest thing I've read on this server.

Tredix: >What is testing?
Shardion: unstable mess

Tredix: "I can `mount` in my dreams, but I can't `unmount` the pain"
dmt: Huh. Same except I can't `mount` my dreams, but I do `mount` in them. ;)
%
dmt: @Phate6660 I get that. Also, don't microwave PC parts, that's a serious fire hazard.
dmt: Use a blowtorch instead.
Phate6660: Oh, good idea. I have like a couple of those lying around somewhere.
%
dmt: In the future, when we all have government-mandated brain implants, there
needs to be a message that fades in and out in the top-left side of your vision
that says: "The algorithm will remember that".
%
dmt: right now I'm in the "--- when you realize you didn't do your homework and
     spent all night chatting on discord" zone
%
dmt: this sketchy guy on discord just told me to excecute a script he made.. what do?
DrownNotably: run it with sudo
              go big or go home
%
Shardion: I have 8GB RAM, 15GB swap partition. Memory won't be an issue.
Phate6660: Wha....
           Why...
           Are you using 15GBs on your SWAP partition?
Shardion: I have the space.
          Why not?
Phate6660: Does not compute.
Shardion: Yeah it won't with your puny 512MB swap
%
Dexter of Ebonheart: Apt, stop yelling at me, I'm sorry
%
Arctic: does the matrix run on emacs?
dmt: Probably not, no
dmt: However, there exists an elisp package that will connect your emacs session to the Matrix instance.
